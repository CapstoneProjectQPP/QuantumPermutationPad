    The increasing threat of quantum computing has
    made it essential to explore new cryptographic
    techniques that can withstand attacks by quantum
    computers. The Quantum Permutation Pad (QPP) is
    a promising solution to this problem, offering a
    quantum-safe cryptographic technique that could
    greatly enhance the security of digital
    communication and data storage in various
    industries, and it has the potential to make a
    significant impact on society.

      <h2>Project Design</h2>
      <p>
        The purpose of the Quantum Permutation Pad
        (QPP) testbed prototype is to assess the
        functionality of the QPP algorithm in an end-to-end
        encryption and decryption system. The prototype
        allows the user to input plaintext via an interface
        on a host machine, which is then transmitted to an
        embedded system for encryption. The encrypted
        data is then sent back to the host machine for
        storage and potential cryptanalysis. Conversely, the
        host machine can send cypher text to the embedded
        system for decryption. The testbed prototype was
        developed using a Xilinx Zybo Z7 FPGA board and
        was programmed using various languages such as
        Xilinx HLS, C++, Python, Flask, Java, and
        JavaScript.

        <h2>Algorithim Design</h2>
        <p>
          QPP is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that
          utilizes permutation logic gates to encrypt and
          decrypt data[2]. The permutation logic gates are
          represented as permutation matrices, where each
          row and column contains only one nonzero
          element, which is always equal to one. Plaintext
          and cyphertext are encoded into basis vectors,
          which are then multiplied with a permutation
          matrix. To enhance the efficiency of the algorithm,
          we replaced the matrix data structure with an array
          that stores the column position of the nonzero value
          for each row. The multiplication operation is then
          achieved by indexing the array with the encoded
          plaintext or cyphertext. The QPP algorithm
          prototype was developed using the C++
          programming language.

        <h2>Hardware Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          The embedded system target is a
          Xilinx Zybo Z7 development board. The Zybo-Z7
          contains an SoC with both FPGA fabric and a dual-
          core Cortex-A9 multiprocessor. The algorithm C++
          prototype was converted to RTL using Xilinx HLS
          (High-level synthesis).The generated RTL was 
          used to instantiate a custom IP core on the FPGA fabric. 
          The host machine communicates with Zybo-Z7 using an
          Ethernet cable.

      <h1>Integrated System</h1>
      <p>
        The QPP testbed includes a command-line interface
        (CLI), web interface, and a Java backend referred
        to as the CoreComplex(CC), all of which are
        platform independent programs which run on the
        user's host machine. The encryption and decryption
        module is referred to as the nodeE, which is
        deployed a Linux process on the Zybo-
        Z7. These components work together to
        achieve end-to-end encryption and decryption.

      <h1>Conclusion</h1>
      <p>
        The testbed serves as an efficient platform for
        assessing the effectiveness and security of the
        QPP algorithm. It allows plaintext or ciphertext 
        input to be encrypted and decrypted using QPP on the
        embedded system, with the output being
        automatically stored on the host machine. Future
        development plans include the addition of the AES-
        256 symmetric-key algorithm to enable a
        comparison against QPP, as well as the scaling of
        the security parameters of QPP to enhance the
        algorithm's performance.
